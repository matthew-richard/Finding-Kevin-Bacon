Finding Kevin Bacon
===================

This is the repository for my 9th assignment in Data Structures, a course I took at JHU as a freshman in Spring 2014!

Currently the assignment is available on http://gaming.jhu.edu/~phf/2014/spring/cs226/assignment-graph-bacon.shtml, but if that isn't the case in the future I've also saved it to Assignment.html.

There were two parts to this assignment:

    1. Implement a direct, sparse graph, and provide a method to
       print it in a format that the GraphViz graph visualizer
       can understand. Test it using the JUnit unit testing
       framework.
       
    2. Having implemented this graph, feed it the IMDB database
       of which actors starred in what movies, then use Breadth-
       First Search to automate the game Six Degrees of Kevin
       Bacon
       
BUILDING:
'make' Should build Kevin.class (run this to play Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon), SparseGraph.class (the graph), and TestGraph.class (the JUnit tests for the graph), provided JUnit, ie junit-4.11.jar, is in the working directory.

IMPORTANT FILES:
*** Note: Lots of boilerplate was already provided for this assignment. The only files students were asked to change and submit were Kevin.java, SparseGraph.java, and TestGraph.java. ***

Assignment.html         The assignment description (written by Peter Frohlich)

action06.txt            IMDB database for which actors starred in which *action*
                        movies. Significantly smaller than all06.txt.

all06.txt               Same as above, but for *all* movies. This is much larger
                        than action06.txt, but makes Kevin.class take longer
                        to complete.
                        
Kevin.java              Compile and run to play Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon. Eg
                        'java Kevin action06.txt "De Rosselli, Rex"' returns
                        the Bacon number of Rex De Rosselli.
                        
TestGraph.java          JUnit tests for SparseGraph.java. To run, use command
                        'java -cp junit-4.11.jar:. org.junit.runner.JUnitCore'
                        or alternatively, 'make testrun'.

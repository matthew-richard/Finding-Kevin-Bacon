In total our code throws 3 'unchecked cast' warnings, all of which
are suppressed with @SuppressWarnings("unchecked"). The first two
are in SparseGraph when we try and validate our Edges and Vertices,
casting them from Edge and Vertex to our inner class, implementation-
specific types DirectedEdge and IncidenceVertex. We have verified
that our casts, though unchecked, are typesafe. In the first two
warnings, we clearly verify that the edge or vertex is an instanceof
one of our inner classes before casting into one of them. We are again
typesafe in the third and last warning in KevinBacon.java; we cast
the Object label returned by the graph to a Vertex, and we know this
is possible because we've only labeled Vertices with other Vertices.
